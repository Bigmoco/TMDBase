# TMDBase
A Kodi build based around the Artic Fuse 2 skin which is developed by jurialmunkey

You can either install this build using my edited version of the OpenWizard addon or using the Archive link, dealers choice.

Let me know if there are any problems.

If manually installing(not on a PC), use the stock OpenWizard, I could never figure out the Backup addon.
