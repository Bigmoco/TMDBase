# TMDBase
**A Kodi build based around the Arctic Fuse 2 skin and TMDb Helper, which are developed by [jurialmunkey](https://github.com/jurialmunkey)**

**Install Instructions:**
------------------------------------
Use a custom version of OpenWizard or manually install using one of the Dropbox links, all options are below. 

**[<u>English Version</u>](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17988163/plugin.program.openwizard.zip)**

**[<u>Spanish Version</u>](https://github.com/Bigmoco/TMDBase/raw/refs/heads/main/language/es/plugin.program.openwizard.zip)**

- Install in Kodi
- Click "Continue"
- Click "Build Menu"
- Click "*(OpenWizard)* Install"
- Click "Yes, Install"
- Done, let it download and install, then click "OK" to force close Kodi.

**[Dropbox - English](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/q4ped8gjdbvb61uoytpj8/AP-2MkeCrWquC4hhnuWpct8?rlkey=3dmnyg8ziy73mzdqdygqrydno&st=5kdaze1n&dl=1)**

**[Dropbox - Spanish](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zobt1lcflkctoupi9xykh/ADmtZQOgBA7hg5k6qR5lp1Q?rlkey=z96obct1vvhebt9nupvlxv0sc&st=58amsq9d&dl=1)**

If manually installing and not on a PC, unzip and use the stock **[OpenWizard](https://a4k-openproject.github.io/repository.openwizard/)**, I could never figure out the Backup addon. You can figure out the rest.

For Ratings (IMDb,RT) you need an **[OMDb API Key](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)**. Just enter the key they email you into the TMDb Helper settings.

Let me know if there are any problems.

A **[Trakt](https://trakt.tv/auth/join)** account is needed too; reload skin after activating. Also, I recommend **[A4K](https://github.com/a4k-openproject/a4kSubtitles)** for subtitle support:)
